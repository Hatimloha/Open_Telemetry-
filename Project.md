```

> As a DevOps Engineer you should understand what this project is doing and how things are happening so letâ€™s understand the docker compose file responsible for deploying the app.

## Understanding the docker compose file structure!

> This Docker Compose file is designed to set up an observability demo environment using various microservices. If you're new to observability, here's how you can understand this setup:
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/docker-compose.yml

## Breakdown of the File:
- **Logging Configuration (`x-default-logging`)**:
    - This section defines how logs are handled. The logs are stored in JSON format with limits on file size (`5m`) and number of files (`2`). The `tag` option adds a name tag to each log entry, which is useful for identifying which service generated the log.
- **Networks**:
    - The `networks` section defines a custom network called `opentelemetry-demo` using the bridge driver, which allows containers to communicate with each other.
- **Services**:
    - Each service represents a different microservice in the application. These microservices work together to form a complete application.

## Service Details:
> Microservices in the app and the languages they are written in.
- Core Demo Services: Application services written in different languages.
- Dependent Services: Services that the application services depend on like Redis, Kafka etc.
- Telemetry Components: Components that deal with the telemetry data generated by the above services like Collector, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenSearch, Jaeger.
